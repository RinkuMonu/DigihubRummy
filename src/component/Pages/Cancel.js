                  <p>We process refunds only under specific circumstances where users have encountered a genuine issue with their transactions. Refunds are applicable in the following cases:</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul className='ps-5'>

                  <b>Failed Transactions: </b>
                  If a user’s payment has been debited but the amount is not credited to their gaming account, they can request a refund. Such issues may arise due to bank delays, network failures, or technical problems within the payment gateway. Users should immediately report such cases to our support team with relevant transaction details for a quick resolution. We ensure that every refund request is thoroughly reviewed, and eligible refunds are processed without unnecessary delays. Our goal is to maintain financial integrity and ensure that users have a hassle-free experience on our platform.

                <li className='list-style-type-decimal'>
                  <b>Unauthorized Transactions: </b>
                  If a transaction occurs without the user’s consent due to a technical or security breach, we offer a refund upon verification. Users are advised to secure their accounts with strong passwords and enable additional security features to prevent unauthorized access. In case of any suspicious transactions, immediate reporting is essential to ensure timely resolution. Our team investigates such cases rigorously, and upon confirming unauthorized activity, we process the refund as per our policy. Ensuring user security and financial safety is our top priority, and we take all necessary measures to prevent fraud.

                  If a user accidentally makes multiple payments for the same deposit, they are eligible for a refund of the extra amount. Duplicate payments may occur due to technical glitches, payment processing errors, or accidental user actions. To claim a refund, users must provide proof of multiple charges along with transaction details. Our team carefully verifies each request to prevent misuse of the policy. Once verified, the excess payment is refunded to the original payment method. We encourage users to review payment confirmations before completing multiple transactions to avoid such issues.

                  If a deposit or withdrawal request fails due to a system malfunction, users can request a refund or reprocessing of the transaction. Such errors may include incomplete processing, server downtimes, or discrepancies in credited amounts. Users must report these issues with relevant transaction details for a thorough investigation. Once the issue is validated, we take the necessary corrective action, either by processing the refund or rectifying the transaction. Our commitment to seamless financial transactions ensures that users do not face unnecessary losses due to technical failures on our platform.

                </b>
                  <p>Once a user joins a game, they cannot cancel participation unless an issue arises due to a technical glitch. If a game is interrupted due to system failure, network issues, or unforeseen technical problems, the game may be canceled, and any associated entry fee will be refunded. The refund process follows our Refund Policy and is subject to verification. Users are encouraged to check their internet stability before joining a game, as personal connectivity issues do not qualify for cancellation. In the case of tournament cancellations from our end, the affected users will be compensated appropriately. Additionally, if a game is canceled due to server maintenance or security updates, all affected users will be notified in advance whenever possible, ensuring a transparent process.

If a duplicate deposit occurs due to a technical error, users can request a refund under our Refund Policy by providing transaction details. Deposits utilized for gameplay or bonuses cannot be reversed. Our platform ensures secure transactions, and users must take responsibility for reviewing deposit confirmations before proceeding. We recommend users set deposit limits and use responsible gaming tools to prevent unintentional transactions. In cases of unauthorized deposits, users must report immediately for a swift resolution. We take all necessary precautions to safeguard user transactions.

                  <p>Users can cancel a withdrawal request if it has not yet been processed by our finance team. Once a withdrawal is approved and initiated, cancellation is not possible. To request cancellation, users must contact Customer Support immediately with transaction details. If a withdrawal request is flagged for verification or compliance checks, users may opt to cancel and reinitiate their request later. We ensure fast and secure withdrawals, and users should verify their banking details before submitting requests to avoid any delays or issues. Withdrawal requests that do not meet our security and verification protocols may be canceled automatically to protect user funds.

Account cancellation means users will lose access to their gaming history, funds, and rewards. Before proceeding, users must withdraw any remaining balance as funds cannot be recovered post-cancellation. Suspended or permanently banned accounts due to policy violations are not eligible for cancellation. We encourage responsible gaming and offer self-exclusion options for users who wish to take a break instead of permanent cancellation. Once an account is deactivated, users must complete a verification process to reactivate it in the future, ensuring user security and compliance.

Once a bonus or promotional offer is applied to an account, cancellation is not possible. Users must review the terms of any promotional campaigns before opting in. If a user mistakenly avails an offer, they must contact Customer Support immediately for assistance. We ensure fair promotional policies and provide users with clear guidelines before enrolling in special offers. Users must meet wagering requirements before withdrawing winnings from promotional funds. Canceled promotions will not be reinstated, and associated benefits will be voided upon cancellation.
