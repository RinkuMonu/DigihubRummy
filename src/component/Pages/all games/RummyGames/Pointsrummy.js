                            <p>Points Rummy is the most fast-paced and action-packed version of Rummy, played in a single round where players compete to form valid sequences and sets before their opponents. Unlike Pool or Deals Rummy, where games stretch over multiple rounds, Points Rummy ensures instant results, making it a favorite among players who enjoy quick gameplay and instant gratification.
                                At FinuniqueRummy , we bring you the most seamless and engaging Points Rummy experience, allowing you to play with real players, test your skills, and win exciting rewards.

                            </p>
                            <p>The game’s straightforward yet strategic nature requires sharp decision-making, quick thinking, and the ability to analyze opponents’ moves. Each point carries a pre-decided monetary value, and winnings are calculated based on the opponents' total points. The player who makes the first valid declaration wins, and the remaining players are penalized based on their ungrouped cards.

                    <p>Points Rummy follows standard Rummy rules, with the key difference being that it is played for points, each carrying a fixed cash value. The game begins with a set number of players, typically 2 to 6, and follows these basic steps</p>

                            <li><b>Winner’s Score –</b> The winner of the game gets zero points, meaning they do not incur any penalties. Their winnings are calculated using the formula:
                                Winnings = (Sum of all opponents’ points) × (Pre-decided point value).
                            </li>

                                The losing players receive penalty points based on the ungrouped cards left in their hands. Each card carries the following value:

                            <li className='mt-3'>By reducing unmatched high-value cards early in the game, players can minimize their losses in case their opponent declares first. Understanding how points are calculated helps players make smarter moves and improves their overall strategy.</li>

                        </h4>
                        <p>Since Points Rummy is a fast-paced game, players need to think quickly and strategically to gain an edge over their opponents. Here are some expert tips to increase your chances of winning:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div className='col-md-3'>

                                    <h4>Prioritize Forming a Pure Sequence – </h4>
                                    <p> A valid declaration requires at least one pure sequence, so focus on forming it as soon as possible. Without a pure sequence, even a well-arranged hand is invalid.</p>

                            </div>

                                    <h4>Utilize Jokers Wisely –</h4>
                                    <p> Jokers can replace any missing card in a sequence or set (except for the pure sequence). Use them strategically to complete combinations and declare faster.

                                    <h4>Discard High-Value Cards Early –</h4>
                                    <p>  Holding onto high-value face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) can be risky. If they do not fit into a sequence or set, discard them early to reduce penalty points.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Observe Your Opponents’ Moves –</h4>
                                    <p> Keep track of which cards your opponents pick and discard. This helps you gauge their strategy and avoid discarding cards that could help them.
