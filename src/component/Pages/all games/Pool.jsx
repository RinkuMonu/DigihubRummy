            <h2>What is Pool?</h2>
            <p>
              Pool is a popular cue sport played worldwide, combining skill, precision, and strategy. It is played on a rectangular table with six pockets, using a cue stick and colored balls. The primary objective varies depending on the variation being played, but the main goal remains the same: to pocket the balls in a specific order while using strategic positioning and shot accuracy.
              Pool is often confused with snooker and billiards, but the main difference is in the table size, number of balls, and game rules. Unlike casual pool games played in clubs, online Pool Games bring the thrill of competitive gameplay, real-time matches, and cash rewards right to your fingertips.

          <h2>How to Play Pool?</h2>
          <p>Pool follows a simple yet strategic gameplay format where players take turns using a cue stick to hit the cue ball, which then strikes the numbered balls to pocket them in the right sequence.

            <ul style={{ lineHeight: "34px" }}>
              <li><strong>Break Shot:</strong> The game begins with one player taking the break shot, aiming to scatter the balls and possibly pocket one.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Choosing Stripes or Solids:</strong>  If the first legal ball is pocketed, that player must continue pocketing the same type—either stripes (9-15) or solids (1-7).
              </li>
              <li><strong>Call Your Shots:</strong> In professional Pool, players must call their shots, indicating which ball they will hit and in which pocket.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Avoid Fouls:</strong>  A foul occurs if a player misses the shot, pockets the cue ball, or fails to hit the designated ball first.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The game is won when a player legally pockets the 8-ball (black ball) after clearing their assigned balls from the table.</li>
