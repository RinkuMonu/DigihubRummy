  const text = `Points Rummy is a fast-paced and thrilling version of the game, 
  where each game lasts for a single round. Players compete for points, 
  with each point carrying a fixed monetary value. The first player to 
  declare a valid set of sequences and sets wins the game, while the 
  opponents are given penalty points based on their unmatched cards.
  This format is ideal for players who prefer quick games and instant results. 
  Since Points Rummy is played in a single round, it allows players to participate 
  in multiple games in a short period, making it a highly engaging and competitive format.`;


  const text2 = `Pool Rummy is a longer and more strategic format, where players start with a predefined number of points, usually 101 or 201. The objective is to keep the score as low as possible, as players get eliminated when their points cross the preset limit. The game continues until only one player remains in the pool.
                    Pool Rummy requires patience, skill, and careful planning, as players must consistently focus on reducing their points while preventing their opponents from winning. This format is perfect for those who enjoy long and intense gameplay sessions.

  const text3 = `In Deals Rummy, a fixed number of rounds (deals) are played, and each player starts with an equal number of chips. The player with the highest number of chips at the end of all deals is declared the winner. This format adds an extra layer of strategy, as players must think ahead and manage their chips efficiently across multiple rounds.
                    Deals Rummy is ideal for those who enjoy structured gameplay with a balanced mix of skill and luck. Since all players start with equal resources, it becomes a fair battle of skill, making it one of the most competitive formats of Rummy.

              <h4>The History and Evolution of Rummy</h4>
              <p>Rummy has an interesting history, with its origins tracing back to several card games played across different cultures. Some believe that Rummy evolved from the Spanish game Conquian, which dates back to the 16th century, while others suggest its roots lie in the Chinese game Mahjong. Over time, the game spread across the world, adapting to regional variations and becoming a popular pastime.
                In India, Rummy has gained massive popularity, especially after the introduction of online gaming platforms. With digital advancements, players can now access different Rummy formats on their smartphones, tablets, and desktops. Platforms likeDigiHUb have revolutionized the way Rummy is played, offering a secure, competitive, and rewarding environment for players of all skill levels.

              <h4>Why Rummy is a Game of Skill?
              </h4>
              <p>Unlike casino games that depend purely on luck, Rummy is a skill-based game where players must strategize their moves, analyze opponents, and make calculated decisions. The outcome of the game depends largely on how well a player arranges their cards and adapts to changing situations.
                The Supreme Court of India has also recognized Rummy as a skill-based game, making it completely legal to play. The game tests various abilities such as memory, observation, critical thinking, and quick decision-making. A skilled player can consistently improve their game by practicing and refining their strategies. This makes Rummy different from games of chance, where players rely solely on luck to win.

                    At the beginning of a Rummy game, each player is dealt 13 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. The game also includes wild jokers, which can be used as substitutes in sequences and sets. One card is selected randomly as the wild joker, and the remaining cards form the draw pile, from which players pick cards on their turn.

                  <p>
                    The primary goal in Rummy is to arrange all 13 cards into valid sequences and sets. A sequence is a group of consecutive cards of the same suit, while a set consists of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. To declare a winning hand, a player must have at least one pure sequence (a sequence without a joker).

                  <p>
                    Players take turns drawing and discarding cards to form valid sequences and sets. A player can pick a card from either the open deck (discard pile) or the closed deck (draw pile). At the end of each turn, one card must be discarded. The game continues until a player successfully arranges all their cards and makes a valid declaration.

                    Once a player declares, the hand is checked for validity. If the declaration is correct, the player wins the game, and the opponentsâ€™ scores are calculated based on their ungrouped cards. The lower the points, the better the chances of staying in the game. If a player makes an invalid declaration, they receive a penalty, and the game continues.
