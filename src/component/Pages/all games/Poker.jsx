              <p className="lead fs-6">
                Poker is one of the most popular and strategic card games played
                worldwide. It is a game of skill, psychology, and mathematical
                calculations, where players compete to form the best hand or use
                bluffing techniques to outplay their opponents.
                <br /> Unlike games based purely on luck, Poker demands sharp
                decision-making, risk management, and an understanding of
                probability. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck,
                and players place bets based on their hand strength or their
                ability to make opponents fold. Different variations like Texas
                Hold'em, Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO) 4, PLO 5, and PLO 6 offer unique
                challenges and strategies, making Poker a thrilling experience.{" "}
